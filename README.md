# MVVM Architecture for iOS by Malav Soni

Hello Everyone,

I am here again with the new stuff which I believe every developer wanted to.

The MVVM for iOS Application. 

I have read so many blogs about the MVVM Architecture and how you should divide the roles and responsibility to different classes which helps you to maintain your code very efficiently. It also helps you to debug your issues as well because you always know which class is responsible for the behaviors and display logics.

The reason why I have made this project is that in every article or blog I have read they always explain some portion of the code while this project can be used as a template to get started with your new application with MVVM.

This project contains all the things which are generally used in any project. 

- API Calls

- Validation

- Business Logic

- View Controller Management

- ViewModel with Protocol

- How to integration MVVM with TableView/CollectionViews

- Navigation Management.

- Localization

- Basic Extensions

- Generalization of Classes
- Test Cases for business logic

I hope you guys like this project.

Before run the project in your device make sure you replace GoogleService-Info.plist with your file and also update the URL Schema for Login with Google.

Please let me know if you think we should make any change in the above architecture or if you want me to add anything else to it.
